# CNEReg    

The main idea of CNEReg is to focus on those toolkit TFs as major players in evo-devo studies to study how those TFs are regulated by RSCNEs and how they utilize RSCNEs to regulate RSEGs. CNEReg models the expression of target genes (TG) conditional on chromatin accessibility of RSCNEs and expression of transcription factors (TF).

# (2) Processed data      
CNEReg model requires input as sample matched time-series RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, and RSCNEs with conservation scores from public data.       
The final processed data are defined as the data on which the conclusions in the related manuscript are based.
